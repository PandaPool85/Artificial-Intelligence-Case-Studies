# Artificial Intelligence Case Studies

**Emotional Intelligence/ Emotion AI:** 

Allows computers to understand human non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions

**Project Overview:**
* Classify peoples emotions into 5 categories (Angry, Disgust, Sad, Happy, Surprise) based on images
* Create a deep learning model based on convolutional Nueral Network and Residual Blocks to predict facial key points
* Deploy model development using TensorFlow Serving
* Make a request in TensorFlow Serving
